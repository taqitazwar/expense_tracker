This repo contains a fullyâ€‘featured Flutter expense tracker:

- âœ… Riverpod for state

- âœ… fl_chart for 3 distinct visualizations
- âœ… Professional UI/UX with empty states
- âœ… Git workflow with protected main + feature branches

## Running

flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Code Generation (Hive)

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
